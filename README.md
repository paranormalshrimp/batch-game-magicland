quick batch file text adventure. right click the file and then click edit to read (& edit) the source code.
there are two hidden directions you will have to find.
thanks so much for playing.

PROBLEM AREA:
windows will prompt you to extaract all files in the .zip but this isn't necesary, it'll run fine on its own.
second, windows will say that it: "protected your PC" by not letting it open, you will need to click the underlined wordes: "more info" then click on the "run anyway" button.
IK its big sketch but im not tryna murder ur computer.
